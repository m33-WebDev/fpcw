Magnesium deficiency may be to blame.  Just how important is sleep? Well, it turns out that lack of sleep has been associated with increased risk of cancer, diabetes, gastrointestinal problems, depression, and overall mortality. Nearly one third of Americans have reported experiencing insomnia, meaning millions suffer every night. The potential health consequences and sheer number of people with insomnia makes the problem ever more urgent to address. Though volumes of scientific literature have devoted space to this topic, few have done enough to document magnesium’s role in potential treatment and prevention of insomnia.\",\"marks\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"data\":{}},{\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\",\"content\":[{\"nodeType\":\"text\",\"value\":\"The biological benefits of magnesium are far-reaching and complex, so it should come as no surprise that many studies have linked poor sleep to calcium and magnesium deficiencies.

No doubt, the mineral’s complex involvement in the biological processes which govern our ability to sleep suggests that magnesium is the solution for many suffering from insomnia. My immediate advice for those looking to manage their insomnia would be to explore whether the cause of this is rooted in a magnesium deficiency. If you are like most Americans, then you are deficient of this vitally important mineral, and are not consuming the recommended daily amount of 400mg for men, or 300mg for women. Choose foods that are high in magnesium, such as dark leafy vegetables, nuts, seeds, and legumes, and pay attention to how you feel psychologically and physically.\",\"marks\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"data\":{}},{\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\",\"content\":[{\"nodeType\":\"text\",\"value\":\"For more nutritional ideas, check out this list of the \",\"marks\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"nodeType\":\"hyperlink\",\"content\":[{\"nodeType\":\"text\",\"value\":\"top five foods high in magnesium\",\"marks\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"data\":{\"uri\":\"https://www.drperlmutter.com/5-foods-high-in-magnesium/\"}},{\"nodeType\":\"text\",\"value\":\".\",\"marks\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"data\":{}}]}"}}},"pageContext":{"pagePath":"having-trouble-with-insomnia-try-increasing-your-magnesium-intake"}}}
